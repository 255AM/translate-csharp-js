# Enemies List

An app that shows you your enemies so you don't forget them.

## Your Task

Read the C# code and write JavaScript code that does the same thing.

> **NOTE:** In your JavaScript code, you may be able to think of more than one way to create an "enemy" object. Any way you do it that works is the **right way**<sup>TM</sup>.

> **NOTE:** This is **NOT** a line-by-line translation of C# code into JavaScript. The task is to write a JavaScript application that _has the same behavior_ as the C# application.

> **NOTE:** The C# code will run in the terminal and the JavaScript code will run in the browser.
